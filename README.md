# Power-BI-CensusBureau
Project working on using census api to bring data into Power BI directly. AS census data can be extremely large, I'm using tmdl file to store in git hub. This is a newer Power BI feature (as of July 2024) that allows saving of Power BI files as project files that can allow for storing large files in a compressed format that does not attempt to hold cached data. There are other gains to tmdl  file format too, check them out!

Project has not been advanced in some time. Tinkering with APIs, for the most part, to get a feel for how best to ingest. I've seen some lovely work in R with API ingestion that I am to replicate with native PBI capability.
